\begin{frame}{The terminal}
        Started as a keyboard driven user interfeace to the operating system's
        kernel                                                            \\
        Grown to not primarily not communicate directly with the kernel   \\

\begin{frame}{``Shell'' vs. ``terminal''}
        Pretty much used interchangeably                                  \\
        Terminal (emulator) controls few things and executes shell        \\
        Shell interprets `commands' and their interfaces                  \\
