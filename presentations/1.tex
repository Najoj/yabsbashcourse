  \begin{frame}{The terminal}
          Started as a keyboard driven user interfeace to the operating system's
          kernel                                                            \\
          Grown to not primarily not communicate directly with the kernel   \\
          More `advanced' scripts to automate                               \\

  \begin{frame}{Shell vs. terminal}
          Pretty much used interchangeably                                  \\
          Terminal (emulator) controls few things and executes shell        \\
          Shell interprets `commands' and their interfaces                  \\

          De-facto standard on GNU+Linux                                    \\
