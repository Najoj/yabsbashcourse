\begin{frame}{Summary}
        Use the right tool for the right task. \\
        \tt{sed} and \tt{awk} are languages themselves, we have only touched upon them. \\
        \tt{grep}, \tt{sed}, and \tt{awk} can usually execute the same task. \\
        \tt{find} is a multi-tool; it can do a lot at once. \\
        \tt{xargs} does one thing well.
